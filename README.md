Document Field Extraction Using BERT Model
This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning model designed to extract specific fields from scanned documents using the BERT model. The model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset tailored for document field extraction tasks.

Introduction
Documents in various industries (like trade, customs, finance, etc.) often contain structured and semi-structured data. This repository focuses on using a fine-tuned BERT model to extract fields like Importer Name, HS Code, Invoice Number, Custom Duty, and more.

Features
Custom Dataset Support: Designed for domain-specific document data.

Preprocessing Pipeline: Includes text cleaning, OCR integration, and dynamic field mapping.

High Accuracy Extraction: Uses BERTâ€™s robust language understanding for precise field identification.

Extensibility: Modular design to accommodate additional fields or document types.

Model Architecture
This project leverages a BERT-based model with the following customizations:

Fine-tuning on token-level classification for BOE fields.
Custom preprocessing to handle OCR text input.
Loss functions optimized for field-wise accuracy.
